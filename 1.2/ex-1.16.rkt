; Exercise 1.16: Design a procedure that evolves an iterative
; exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses
; a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt.
; (Hint: Using the observation that (b ^ n/2 )^2 = (b ^ 2 )^ n/2 , keep,
; along with the exponent n and the base b, an additional
; state variable a, and define the state transformation in such
; a way that the product a * b^n is unchanged from state to state.
; At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and the
; answer is given by the value of a at the end of the process.
; In general, the technique of defining an invariant quantity
; that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful
; way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)
